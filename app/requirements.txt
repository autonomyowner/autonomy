To generate a `requirements.txt` file you need to list all the dependencies your project needs. In Python, this is usually done manually by developers as they know which libraries their application uses. Here's an example of what the requirements might look like for your project:

```text
Flask==2.0.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.1
Flask-Login==0.5.0
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
docker==4.3.1
pytest==6.2.2
```

This is a very basic example and the versions are just examples. You should replace them with the versions you're actually using or use ranges (e.g., `Flask>=2.0.0,<2.1.0`) to specify which version range your application is compatible with. 

To install these packages from this file, use pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You should run this command on a virtual environment where you want to install the dependencies for your project. If not using a virtual environment, it's recommended to use one as it keeps your global python installation clean and allows you to isolate each project's libraries from others.
