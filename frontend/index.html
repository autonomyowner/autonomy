Building such a system is quite extensive and beyond the scope of this AI's capabilities. However, I can provide you a basic example of how to create a dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be a very simple one-page dashboard with two sections: one for user login and another for field tracking.

HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>SaaS Dashboard</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Farm Management SaaS Platform</h1>
    </header>
    
    <section id="login-form">
        <h2>User Login</h2>
        <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Username" />
        <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" />
        <button onclick="login()">Login</button>
    </section>
    
    <section id="field-tracking">
        <h2>Field Tracking</h2>
        <!-- Map or other visualization of field data will go here -->
    </section>

    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS (styles.css):
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

header {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

section {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #dee2e6;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

JavaScript (scripts.js):
```javascript
function login() {
    var username = document.getElementById('username').value;
    var password = document.getElementById('password').value;
    
    // Add your actual authentication logic here
    alert("Username: " + username + ", Password: " + password);
}
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and lacks many features you would expect from a production-ready SaaS platform, such as form validation, error handling, secure user authentication, etc. Also, the satellite data integration and field tracking part are not included in the sample code above because they require complex back-end systems and might be better handled by specialized tools or libraries.
