To build a massive, enterprise-grade SaaS web platform with the features of Amazon, Facebook, and Notion, we will need to use a combination of technologies and frameworks. Here's a suggested plan for building such an app using Flask and FastAPI:

1. Backend:
	* Use Flask as the primary backend framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
	* Implement various APIs for different features, such as user authentication, e-commerce management, social networking, and productivity tools.
	* Utilize a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store data and handle queries.
	* Use Flask's built-in support for SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.
2. Frontend:
	* Use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js for building the user interface.
	* Implement various components for different features, such as product listings, social media feed, and task management.
	* Utilize a state container (e.g., Redux) to manage the application's global state.
3. Security:
	* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using Flask-Login and Flask-Principal.
	* Use SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between the client and server.
4. Scalability:
	* Implement load balancing using a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances.
	* Use a distributed task queue (e.g., Celery) to handle background tasks and improve system responsiveness.
5. Testing:
	* Write unit tests for individual components using Flask's built-in testing framework.
	* Implement integration tests for the overall system using tools like Selenium or Pytest.
6. Deployment:
	* Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) to deploy the application.
	* Set up automated deployment using tools like Ansible or Terraform.
7. Monitoring and logging:
	* Implement monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
	* Use these tools to track system performance, detect errors, and analyze user behavior.
8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
	* Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
	* Automate the build, test, and deployment process for the application.
9. Project structure:
	* Use a modular project structure with separate folders for each feature or component.
	* Implement version control using Git.
10. Documentation:
* Write comprehensive documentation for the entire project, including architecture diagrams, API documentation, and usage guides.

By following this plan, we can build a massive, enterprise-grade SaaS web platform with the features of Amazon, Facebook, and Notion. The final project size will depend on the complexity of each feature and the amount of data stored in the database, but it should be around 700MB or more.
